# Bags for the Homeless Outreach

## Description
```
A brief description of my project

Bags for the Homeless is an outreach project that donates bags of supplies to homeless people. We aim to start a movement that is focused on helping the homeless community to improve their lives and start a path to positive change. This project is the origin of the website where donors can share their story about how they helped provide supplies to the homeless community.
